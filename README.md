<!-- badges: end -->

This package is in a very preliminary state. It has some structural
beams and a bit of plumbing but is not yet capable of fulfilling its
eventual purpose: To construct path diagrams in R via ggplot2, but with
a TiKz-like workflow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggpathdiagramr like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("wjschne/ggpathdiagramr")
```
